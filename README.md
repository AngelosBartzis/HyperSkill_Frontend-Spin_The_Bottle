This is the *Spin The Bottle* project I made myself.

"Spin The Bottle" is a fun and interactive web application designed to facilitate the random selection of players for games, activities, or any scenario where randomness adds excitement. Inspired by the classic party game, this project brings a modern twist to the concept, leveraging web technologies to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
